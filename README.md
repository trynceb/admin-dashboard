# Ecomverse

Ecomverse is an admin dashboard that displays all your data in one place, from product details to transactions. You can look up each customer and also see they are located. You can also get a monthly and daily breakdown of your sales, as well as performance details. This is achieved by taking all the information from the database and making RESTful API calls to display it on the front-end (mock data is used).

## Deployment

Ecomverse is currently deployed at https://ecomverse-tfig.onrender.com
